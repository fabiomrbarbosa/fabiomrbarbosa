### Hi, my name is Fábio 👋🏻

Welcome! I'm a web developer who also works in the fields of advertising, scriptwriting, translation and more. I'm passionate about open Web standards, semantics and accessibility, and implementing creative and media solutions with a purpose. I'm here to help you manifest the Bigger Picture.

👯 I'm looking to shift from my usual corporate work to collaborating more often with projects and brands committed to a transformative vision, with greater awareness, authenticity and sustainability.

💬 Ask me about my principles for a better Web and better brand communication: 
  1. A brand is only as strong as its set of values.
  2. Every message must have a purpose.
  3. Form **must** follow function.

  Or just pop in anytime for a chat about social affairs, life and the universe.

📫 Reach me through [e-mail](mailto:fabio@fabiobarbosa.com) or on social media via the handle @fabiomrbarbosa.
