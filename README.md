### Hi, my name is Fábio 👋🏻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabiomrbarbosa/fabiomrbarbosa/main/banner.min.svg" alt="Fábio M.R. Barbosa — Creative consultant + developer, writer, mystic, traveller. Social media handle: @fabiomrbarbosa. Email: hello@fabiomrbarbosa.com">

Welcome! I'm a web developer who also works in the fields of advertising, scriptwriting, translation and more. I'm passionate about open Web standards, semantics and accessibility, and implementing creative and media solutions with a purpose. I'm here to help you manifest the Bigger Picture.

🌱 I'm currently learning more about SVG, animations and what new frameworks like React or Vue can bring to the table.

👯 I'm looking to shift from my usual corporate work to collaborating more often with projects and brands committed to a transformative vision, with greater awareness, authenticity and sustainability.

💬 Ask me about my principles for a better Web and better brand communication: 
  1. A brand is only as strong as its set of values.
  2. Every message must have a purpose.
  3. Form **must** follow function.

📫 Reach me through [e-mail](mailto:hello@fabiomrbarbosa.com), on social media via the handle @fabiomrbarbosa, or subscribe my [newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gNzLRz), which I intend to start shipping soon.
